This folder contains the hidden files:
.myshrc
.mysh_history


See 'myshrcExampleFile.txt' for an example '.myshrc' file.
You must have exact formatting.
Not having the '.myshrc' file will simply cause the program to use default values.
Note: You will need this file in order to permanently add to $PATH or change default settings for history stuff.

See 'mysh_historyExampleFile.txt' for an example '.mysh_history' file.
If you choose to supply this file, it must match exact formatting.
Not having the '.mysh_history' file will simply cause the program to create one for you.
